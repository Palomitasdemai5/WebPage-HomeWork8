        After some studies, scientists have revealed new discoveries about the relationship between blood type and COVID-19 infection, since there is a different reaction in each of the types.

The specialists even explained that the susceptibility to a COVID-19 infection can vary according to the blood type: people with type O may have the lowest risk, while those with A and AB may have a greater risk of severe clinical conditions.

These are two conclusions of two works published in the Blood Advances journal; It is not the first time that a study links these blood groups with a greater or lesser vulnerability to contagion and a better or worse evolution of the disease.

Last June, an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine pointed out that genes can determine that some people develop severe forms of COVID and that having type A blood was associated with a 50% higher risk of needing respiratory support, while group O conferred "protective effect".

Now, in one of the published research, it is suggested that people with blood type O may have a lower risk of COVID-19 infection and, of contracting the disease, a lower probability of serious results, including complications in the organs , according to a note from the American Hematological Society.

To reach these conclusions, the researchers compared data from the Danish health registry of more than 473,000 people who were tested for Covid with data from a control group of more than 2.2 million individuals from the general population.

Among those who tested positive for COVID-19, they found fewer people with blood type O and more people with types A, B and AB; the researchers found no significant difference in the infection rate between types A, B, and AB.

In another retrospective study, scientists found that people with blood groups A or AB seem to show a greater severity of the disease than people with blood groups O or B.
