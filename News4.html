      Creativity, thinking big, surrounding yourself with people who add, but, above all, honesty and professionalism are key factors to enter entrepreneurship.

This was stated by the founder and president of the Acosta Verde Plazas Sendero Group, Jesús Acosta Verde, during his participation in the Authentic Entrepreneurs program of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León.

You have to understand the market
When looking to undertake creativity, it is worth gold, but something fundamental is that the market must be understood.

"Mexico is a supermarket, it is a country of opportunities and what you have to do is put on the table a product that is essential and compatible with the needs of the public," said Acosta Verde.

But for this, it is essential to surround yourself with people who contribute or add something, getting closer to people who have greater strengths and capabilities than you may have.

Honesty and professionalism, keys to entrepreneurship
"Regardless of whether they are going to associate with friends or family, it is important that they coincide in the interests and direction they want for their company," emphasized the native of Matamoros, Tamaulipas.

Failure, an opportunity for growth
Today, entrepreneurship is for everyone. Each one can be encouraged to offer a service or product and continue on this path having a clear vision.

However, we must also understand that there are problems in this process, but the bigger they are, the greater the growth.

“Failures are really the great opportunity for you to grow. They are the ones who teach you and you must show what you are made of.
