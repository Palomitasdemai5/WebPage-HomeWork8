      Vaccines do not save lives by themselves but rather the immunization process does. This shows the enormous challenge that the world faces right now. The development method used to create a vaccine in the laboratory is different from that used by the pharmaceutical industry to achieve immunity to the population.

We already produce billions of doses of vaccines each year, from flu to joint vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella. The 2009 swine flu pandemic, in which hundreds of thousands of people died, led to some 3 billion doses being produced and delivered in just six months.

Developing a new vaccine is a long process. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 killed more than 11,000 people.

Scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada have been working on the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine since 2003 and it was not until the Ebola outbreak that clinical trials were completed. Its development concluded in November 2016 and it was finally approved three years later, only after conducting an additional study with 15,000 people.

Creating and producing an entirely new vaccine on a global or national scale while maintaining production of the rest of the vaccines is a Herculean effort, experts say.
