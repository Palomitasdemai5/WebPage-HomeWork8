      During the television program "La UNAM Responde", the researcher commented that, despite the fact that the suicide figures in Mexico are not high as in other regions of the world, in recent years there has been an increase in the population.

Arenas Landgrave recalled that in 2017 women between the ages of 15 and 19 had the highest suicide rate with four per 100,000 women, while, in the case of men, 15.1 suicides occurred per 100,000 young people aged 20 to 24 years, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI).

The university student highlighted that "75 percent of the cases the people who committed suicide had a type of associated disorder, such as depression or anxiety disorders," and explained that the factors that lead a person to commit suicide can be multiple and range from life history, personality alterations, as well as genetic and epigenetic factors.

However, he commented that suicide is a problem in which society can participate to avoid it, paying attention to suicidal behaviors or expressions and looking for mental health experts for their attention in case of detecting them.

He also recalled that exercising, staying constantly active, sleeping at regular times, eating in a balanced way, and having communication with family, friends and co-workers, even through social networks and the telephone, are actions that can be avoided. suicidal thoughts.

The university commented that UNAM has worked collaboratively with the faculties of Medicine, Psychology and Obstetrics to better serve the university community, especially people who are already at risk.

And he recalled that the Los Volcanes Community Center for Psychological Care, for which he is responsible, provides care to the population living in the south of Mexico City, with counseling on issues related to mental health, workshops for adults and other activities.
